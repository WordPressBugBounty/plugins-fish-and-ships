###Setup exact shipping rates through a table rate shipping

Fish and Ships is a **WooCommerce table rate shipping** based method that helps you to increase sales and avoid costs losses, through an easy-to-use table rate shipping cost, with multiple conditional options (as needed).

You can set multiple conditional rules on the table rate: based on price, weight, product quantity on cart, dimensions, volume, shipping class, product tag, and product category.

While there are other table rate shipping calculation plugins, only Fish and Ships allows you to add multiple criteria selections to every rule:

*(condition #1 AND condition #2 AND condition #3)*, or (condition #1 OR condition #2 OR condition #3)... as you needed, on every rule!

...from the simplest to the most complex selection criteria, any need can be fulfilled!

= Here is the list of all selection methods: =

* Price
* Weight
* Volume
* Cart items
* Min/Mid/Max dimensions
* In shipping class
