<h2>32 conditional selection methods on shipping rules</h2>
<p>Advanced Shipping Rates for WooCommerce comes with a large range of <strong>selection methods</strong>, these are:</p>

<table class="methods striped">
<thead><tr><th colspan="2"><p class="subtitle">Product-data based selectors</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td class="td_title"><h3>Price:</h3></td>
		<td>
			<p>Price of the product. If there is a sale price, it will be used.</p>
			<p>Regardless of the "Prices entered with tax" WooCommerce setting (can be tax included or tax excluded), price products <strong>will be taken as entered</strong> in the edition page.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="td_title">
			<h3>Weight:</h3>
		</td>
		<td>
			<p>If the products haven't weight set, 0 will be taken.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="td_title"><h3>Volume:</h3></td>
		<td>
			<p>The taken value will be the multiplication of <strong>Width x Height x Length</strong>. If size has not been seet, 0 will be taken.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="td_title"><h3>Volumetric&nbsp;<span class="fns-pro-icon darker">PRO</span>, <br>Volumetric set&nbsp;<span class="fns-pro-icon darker">PRO</span>:</h3></td>
		<td>
<p>For the <strong>volumetric weight</strong> based methods, two values will be considered: real weight and volumetric weight, and the highest value will be used. When selecting volumetric weight, a <a href="#volumetric">new field appears</a> below the rules table so that you can enter the <strong>volumetric weight factor</strong>, you should get it from your transport agency.</p>
		<p>NOTE: Volumetric set will considere all volume products vs all weight products of the group, unlike volumetric, that will compare weight vs volume product per product and SUM the result after that.</p>

		<td class="td_title"><h3>Min dimension, <br />Mid dimension, <br />Max dimension:</h3></td>
		<td>
			<p>Each of them will consider, respectively, the <strong>small, middle and large dimension</strong> of the products. It does not matter if the sizes have been entered from small to large, or from large to small, in a product of: 10x15x1 or 15x1x10, the max dimension will always be 15, the mid 10, and the min 1. This method always take the products one by one, regardless of the grouping method chosen. If a product have not size set, the value 0 will be taken.</p>

		<td class="td_title"><h3>Length+Width +Height&nbsp;<span class="fns-pro-icon darker">PRO</span>:</h3></td>

		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="td_title"><h3>Length+Girth&nbsp;<span class="fns-pro-icon darker">PRO</span>:</h3></td>

			<p>The value taken will be the formula result: <strong>Length + 2 * Width + 2 * Height</strong> of product dimensions. In a product of: 10x15x1, it will be: <strong>10+2x15+2x1 = 42</strong>. This method always take the products one by one, regardless of the grouping method chosen. If a product have not size set, the value 0 will be taken.</p>

			<p>Note that the group-by criteria can be confusing here! For example: if you set to non-group then products will be taken one by one, so quantity becomes always&nbsp;1 for comparison. (see <a href="group_by.html" class="wc_fns_nav_popup" data-fns-tip="group_by">group-by</a>).</p>

	<tr>
		<td class="td_title"><h3>Number of groups:</h3></td>

			<p>The number of groups, depending on the group-by strategy.

<h2>Greater than / Greater than or equal to &amp; Less than / Less than or equal to</h2>
				
<p>Most selector methods uses fields of minimum and maximum value.</p>

<p>For all this selectors, you can choose how the MIN and MAX values will be compared, switching to the appropiate symbol on every rule as you need.</p>

<p>In the following table, we are set MIN comparison as <strong>GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO</strong> $5, and MAX comparison as <strong>LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO</strong> $30</p>
				
<p><img src="img/min-max-new-1.png" width="700" height="101" alt="GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO" /></p>

		<td class="rule"><span class="dashicons dashicons-dismiss"></span> $30.01</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>In the second table, we are set MIN comparison as <strong>GREATER THAN</strong> $30, and MAX comparison as <strong>LESS THAN</strong> $100, there is: the equal values will not match this rule:</p>

<p><img src="img/min-max-new-2.png" width="700" height="101" alt="GREATER THAN" /></p>
<table class="wp-list-table widefat striped tags" style="max-width:700px">

		<td class="rule"><span class="dashicons dashicons-dismiss"></span> $100.00</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>				

<p>Note that <strong>$30.00</strong> match on rule #1 because the MAX field comparison is <strong>LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO</strong>, and not match rule #2 because the MIN does the comparison with <strong>GREATER THAN</strong>.</p>

<p>On the other side, <strong>$100</strong> not match rule #2 because the MAX field comparison is <strong>LESS THAN</strong>.</p>

			<a href="img/volumetric.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/volumetric.png" width="659" height="245" alt="Volumetric weight factor" /></a></p>
			<p>How it works? Let's say a volumetric weight factor of 3.5 lb/ft<sup>3</sup>. Our shop example is configured to work with pounds and inches, converted, is: 0.002 pounds per cubic inch, (here you have <a href="https://www.wp-centrics.com/volumetric-weight-rates-shipping-calculator-woocommerce/#volumetric-weight-conversor" target="_blank">volumetric weight conversor units</a> for volume/weight):</p>

					<td>1440 in<sup>3</sup></td>
					<td class="align_center">1440 * 0.002 = <br />2.88 lbs</td>
					<td class="align_center"><strong>5 lbs</strong></td>
				</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>On lightweight products, the taken value will be the calculated volumetric weight. In heavy products, the weight value will be taken. <strong>Always the highest value</strong>.</p>
